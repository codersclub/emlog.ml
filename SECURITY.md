# Security Vulnerability Reporting Guide

Thank you for your security research and responsible vulnerability disclosure!
Please do not publicly report security vulnerabilities in GitHub Issues.

To report security issues, please submit them in the following ways:

- Submit through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/emlog/emlog/security/advisories)

We will confirm and respond to your report as soon as possible.
For confirmed and fixed issues, we will apply for CVE and make it public
after 3 months to prevent malicious exploitation.

Thank you for your support!
